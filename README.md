# FreeBSD Bastille Jail migration from AMD64 to AARCH64
This is how how I migrated an existing BastilleBSD jail that was originally built using amd64 binaries to run correctly on an aarch64 (ARM64) FreeBSD host. This (possibly) preserves your jail configuration and data without recreating the jail from scratch.
